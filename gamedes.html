  <h2>CPUATK - A Reverse Tower Defense Game</h2>
  <p>CPUATK was conceived from a prompt given to our team of student game designers.
    The prompt suggested that we create a game using the idea of viruses and
    glitches that exist in real life. This was in conjunction to a dialogue
    the class was previously having about the book World War Z by Max Brooks.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Our idea behind making CPUATK was to create a reverse tower defense
      game where you as a player, would select waves of viruses to send out
      to attack the different components of the CPU. The player has the option
      to send out three different types of viruses that have a range of attack
      values, that change depending on the virus selected.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As the lead artist, I chose to go for a unique design style
        where the look and the feel of the game leaned towards a minimal style.
        The decision to go with this design scheme came from the idea that we
        didn't want to represent the components of the CPU realistically.
        The idea of a minimal style involves the use of simplifying existing
        ideas of something. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The biggest challenge that we were faced with was to create all
          of the components using a very distinct style but to also make
          them recognizable and relatable to the player. The style we chose
          was to use a minimal white on all of the components, but to highlight
          the differences in each of them we used a distinct color, a color that
          was uniform with the function of the object. The towers were given a
           purple, and the targets a gold, so that they stood out to the player,
           knowing what was important in the game, setting a hierarchy. </p>
    <br>

    <p>The most difficult task was to visualize the computer virus,
      something which does not have visual property to. One of the directions
      we could have gone to was making the viruses look organic. Something that
      wouldn't have necessarily fit our requirements for the game. I ended up
      choosing to create multiple viruses based on their descriptions and their
      abilities. Keeping the style uniform in terms of design and color and
      trying making sure they were a good representation of a virus.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Creating towers was a straight forward approach, using existing
        components on the motherboard and adding our unified style according
        to the overall look of the game.</p>
        <div class="towers">

          <img src="img/gamedes/tower_04.png">
        </div>
        <p>The targets were supposed to be the most important components
          of the motherboard. These had to be highlighted accordingly and
          unified so that the player could distinctly identify them.
          We chose a gold highlight so that they stood out in the game.</p>

      <h2>Zombie God - A Top Down Strategy Game</h2>
      <p>This was a game conceived from an idea that stemmed from the
        book World War Z by Max Brooks. The book spoke about a group of
        humans trying to escape a horde of zombies by trying to move up north,
        where it was much colder but it also meant that the zombies couldn't
        reach the humans.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We as a team ran with this idea but turned it over its head.
          We chose to become the Zombie God. The objective of the game is to
          control hordes of zombies and try to kill or convert all of the
          humans on the map. </p>

          <img src="img/gamedes/designDoc.jpg">
          <p>As part of the design team, I was in charge of creating the
            background map for the game. I started off by creating individual
            tiles for the vast map. We soon noticed that this was an issue and
            that the map was not random enough. Thus we chose to procedurally
            generate maps based on creating quarter tiles, that could be assembled
            together to create a map that was different every time you played the game.
            This helped in making the map and terrain more believable and kept
            things interesting for the player.</p>
