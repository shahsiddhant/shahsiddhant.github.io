    <h2>The Swaraj Project</h2>
    <p>The Swaraj Project is an urban farm in Rochester, NY that hopes to bridge the
    gap between our food and where it comes from. This was what gave the logo its shape.
    To stay true to the roots while also showing the growth by means of the flower.</p>

    <h2>SS Motors</h2>
    <p>
      SS Motors is a fictional car company that is producing vehicles like the SS01.
      A car company needs a logo that is simple but also long lasting and extremely recognizable
      in the world around us. One should look at this logo on a car and know that it was produced by
      SS Motors.

    <h2>The NorSwegian Baker</h2>
    <p>
      This was a project undertaken to create the logo for a baking company called The NorSwegian Baker.
      The idea behind this being the baker is a very strong character but has a soft side for baking cupcakes.
