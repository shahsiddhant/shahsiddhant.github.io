  <h2> SS Motors Website</h2>
  <p>
  The objective of this was to create a website for a fictional car company called
  SS Motors and their flagship car, the all electric, SS01. The idea for this
  stemmed from the need to showcase a website created from scratch and my love for cars.
  This website showcases the SS01, a car that was originally created for an animated short film
  that is set in a universe nobody leaves their cars. This car was, in a sense the hero of this
  film. Thus, warranting the need for a website of its own.

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
  This navigation bar features multiple links to the different parts of the website.
  The user can visit the features page, that highlights most important features that
  the SS01 offers. The user can also customize their very own SS01 on the Bespoke page.
  And finally, the user can order their selected model on the Purchase Page.
  The About Us page goes into the company philosophy.
