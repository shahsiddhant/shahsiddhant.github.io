        <h2>Transcom Mobile Live View</h2>
        <p>
          The brief of this project was to create a web based mobile version of
          the client's existing mapping interface. This interface would have multiple layers that could be toggled by the user.
          Like speed, traffic, and other transit information.
          The goal was to create a simple design that was coherent and easy to use.

          Here are some of the initial designs that I came up with. Some were liked better than the others.

        <p>
          After the first round of designs were discussed upon, I went forward with creating a detailed navigation layout.

        <p>
          This was an alternative to the navigation layout.

        <h2> SS Motors Website</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this was to create a website for a fictional car company called SS Motors and their flagship car, the all electric, SS01. The idea for this stemmed from the need to showcase a website created from scratch and my love for cars. This website
            showcases the SS01, a car that was originally created for an animated short film that is set in a universe nobody leaves their cars. This car was, in a sense the hero of this film. Thus, warranting the need for a website of its own.

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            This navigation bar features multiple links to the different parts of the website. The user can visit the features page, that highlights most important features that the SS01 offers. The user can also customize their very own SS01 on the Bespoke page.
            And finally, the user can order their selected model on the Purchase Page. The About Us page goes into the company philosophy.
